## Ciao 👋 My name is Angus (@amoreo71)

📍 I am a PhD researcher at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM).

✏️ I work on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) predominantly among Gram-negative bacteria, as well as neglected tropical disease (NTD) surveillance. My PhD research focuses on linking the genomic surveillance of AMR and schistosomiasis in rural areas of Malawi.
